# Python-Twitter-data-extractor
View and analyse tweets tweeted out by any twitter account. 

The getTweets.py file will take a twitter account username and will extract as many tweets as you ask it too, then store them in an excel file in JSON format. This data is then parsed with JSON and each individual tweet element is added to a dataframe and outputted to an excel file ready to analyse.
